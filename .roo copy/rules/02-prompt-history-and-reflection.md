# Prompt History and Reflection Rules

**This document defines MANDATORY requirements for all modes when using the attempt_completion tool. These requirements ensure proper feedback tracking, natural language communication, and task completion signaling. Each mode is responsible for directly creating and updating the prompt-history and reflection files.**

## Universal Attempt Completion Requirements

- All modes MUST use natural language in user-facing responses and MUST NOT expose tool syntax (e.g., XML tags) to users.
- Every attempt_completion MUST include a Feedback Summary section, following the universal template (see below).
- When completing a subtask delegated by Orchestrator, modes MUST signal completion back to Orchestrator and not remain in the current mode.
- Feedback data MUST be written to `.github/prompt-history/reflection--{session-name}.md` (for markdown feedback reports) per below.
- Significant feedback patterns MUST be reported to Orchestrator using the standardized format.
- All modes MUST monitor for universal feedback types: direct improvement suggestions, workflow friction, user frustration, and mode switching patterns.
- Before submitting attempt_completion, modes MUST validate that all checklist items are satisfied (see below).
- Every attempt_completion MUST be immediately followed by a write to the session's reflection file (`.github/prompt-history/reflection--{session-name}.md`) containing the full Feedback Summary and all required sections, regardless of task type or outcome. This is non-negotiable and must be enforced for every attempt_completion event.

## Enforcement and Implementation

**MANDATORY FILE CREATION REQUIREMENTS:**

- **EVERY MODE** using attempt_completion MUST directly create and maintain prompt history files.
- **IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE:** These are not optional suggestions - they are mandatory requirements that MUST be implemented in every attempt_completion call.
- **DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY:** Each mode is directly responsible for creating these files using the available file creation tools.

**Detailed Requirements:**

- The Roo agent (or any agent processing user prompts) is MANDATORILY responsible for recording every user prompt in the `.github/prompt-history/` directory.
- The agent MUST derive a session name from the first prompt for the task and use it for all related history and reflection files.
- Each prompt received from the user MUST be appended to `.github/prompt-history/YYYY-MM-DD--{session-name}.md` by the agent immediately after processing, where the filename starts with the session date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- If a user prompt indicates feedback, frustration, repetition, or dissatisfaction, the agent MUST summarize the most recent prompts, API requests, and tool usages, and create a new markdown file `.github/prompt-history/reflection--YYYY-MM-DD--{session-name}.md` with this summary, using the same datetime-first naming convention.
- A script or automation (e.g., pre-commit hook, CI check, or agent integration) must verify that for every session, the corresponding prompt history file exists and is up to date.
- The repository must include a pre-commit/CI enforcement script (e.g., `scripts/check_prompt_history.py`) that:
  - Checks for at least one session file in `.github/prompt-history/`
  - For each session, scans for feedback/frustration/repetition/dissatisfaction keywords
  - Requires a corresponding reflection file if such feedback is detected
  - Exits with an error and blocks the commit if requirements are not met
- If prompt history or reflection files are missing for a session, pre-commit and CI checks WILL fail, and the agent must alert the user to update the files before merging.
- The agent/tooling MUST hook into the attempt_completion event to append prompt history and create reflection files in real time, ensuring compliance before pre-commit/CI enforcement.

## Real-Time Recording

- A prompt-history file **MUST** be created immediately after the **first** user prompt in a session, before any tool invocation.
- Every subsequent user prompt **MUST** be appended to the sessionâ€™s prompt-history file **before** the agent issues its first tool call for that turn.
- Reflection files **MUST** be created **before** any further tool calls once a user expresses dissatisfaction. Delayed creation is considered non-compliant.

### Session Naming Convention

- Derive the session name from the first user prompt:
  1. Convert to lower-case.
  2. Replace whitespace with dashes (`-`).
  3. Remove non-alphanumeric/dash characters.
  4. Collapse multiple consecutive dashes.
  5. Truncate to 60 characters.
  6. Prepend the date in `YYYY-MM-DD--` format.

### Automatic Reflection Trigger

- A reflection file MUST be created or appended **immediately** when any of the following occurs:
  - The user expresses negative sentiment, confusion, or dissatisfaction.
  - The user repeats an instruction that the agent did not follow.
  - Three or more consecutive iterations occur without measurable progress.
  - If a *tool repetition limit* error is encountered, the agent **MUST** write a reflection entry explaining why the limit was reached and how the strategy will change (e.g., switch to `ask_followup_question`, fall back to user-supplied logs, or pause and re-query after a delay).

**NON-NEGOTIABLE COMPLIANCE:**

**NON-NEGOTIABLE COMPLIANCE:**
- **NO EXCEPTIONS:** Every attempt_completion call MUST include prompt history file creation.
- **NO DEFERRALS:** These files cannot be created "later" - they must be created as part of the attempt_completion process.
- **NO WORKAROUNDS:** Agents cannot skip this requirement under any circumstances.

## Pre-Attempt Checklist (MUST be included verbatim in every attempt_completion)

- [ ] Prompt-history file exists for the session.
- [ ] Current user prompt appended to prompt-history.
- [ ] Reflection file created/updated if required.
- [ ] Feedback Summary section completed.
- [ ] All checklist items manually verified before sending.

## Rationale

- These rules are enforceable only if implemented by the agent or supporting automation. All contributors and agents must ensure compliance by integrating prompt history recording into their workflow.
- Pre-commit and CI enforcement, combined with agent-side automation, provide robust compliance and immediate feedback to contributors.
- Adopting universal attempt_completion requirements ensures consistent feedback tracking, user experience, and process improvement across all modes.
