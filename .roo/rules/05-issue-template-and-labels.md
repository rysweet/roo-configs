# Issue Template and Labeling for AI-Created Issues

- All issues created by Roo Code or any coding agent must use a dedicated issue template.
- The template must clearly indicate that the issue was created by an AI or coding agent.
- All AI-created issues must be labeled (e.g., `ai-created` or `agent-created`) for easy identification and tracking.
- The template should include fields for context, steps to reproduce (if applicable), and a summary of the agent's reasoning or actions.
- Ensure the template and label are present and used for all automated issue creation.
